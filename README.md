# Case

A) Used tech-stack


B) A brief description of the challenges you face


C) What did you learn from this project?


D) Answers of the additional questions

1) In this project, I used beautifulSoup library which led me to work with xml files. If I could use json format, this project would be significantly faster. Json is a language that is easy to read and use.  In fact, it has been developed on the basis that the XML language remains large and slow during data exchange. It takes less space than XML files. In a major project that does not require a strict security, using RESTful services is considerably more efficient than using Soap services because of this difference.
2) Application Programming Interface(API) is a software tool that allows two applications to communicate with each other. Data is stored in a database on a physical server. To get that data, talking to that database is necessary. Thatâ€™s what an API does, it increases functionality.
